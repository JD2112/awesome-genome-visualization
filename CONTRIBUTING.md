# Contributing guidelines

This file loosely follows on the tradition of "awesome lists" https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md

I will basically incorporate any suggestion and the definition of a genome visualization is pretty loose

Just keep things in alphabetical order, and add it to a category if there is one

Some categories, such as the large "Other" category should probably be characterized better

The website is not deployed using TOOLS.json

To deploy the website

cd awesome-genome-visualization
npm run deploy

To develop
npm run develop
