# Contributing guidelines

This file loosely follows on the tradition of "awesome lists" https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md

I will basically incorporate any suggestion and the definition of a genome visualization is pretty loose

The README on the github website is automatically generated from TOOLS.json. If you want you can submit a PR against the README.md format but I'd prefer if you update the TOOLS.json with your tool, add a picture to the awesome-genome-visualization/static/ folder too!


## Deploying

    cd awesome-genome-visualization
    yarn deploy

## Updating README.md

    node index.js > README.md
